- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    - Getting through #5. This took some help and collaboration on studyhall and it was a great exercise communicating and explaining to each other. While I learned a lot about functions, our study group started to find how to best help each other learn
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
    - Functions can accomplish just about anything, take in virtually any data you can consider collecting and having them purposed towards anything
